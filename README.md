### Hi there 👋

I’m **David Iguta**, an AI / Software Engineer based in **Indianapolis, IN**.  
I recently completed my **M.S. in Applied Data Science** at **Indiana University Indianapolis** and I’m passionate about building **agentic AI systems** that automate real-world workflows—without sacrificing reliability or human oversight.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

### **AutoSDLC — Agentic AI Software Delivery Platform**
I built an **end-to-end AutoSDLC pipeline** where a team of AI agents collaborates across the full software development lifecycle.

- 🧠 **Business Analyst Agent** → gathers requirements & generates PRDs  
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Agent** → implements production-ready applications  
- 🧪 **QA Agent** → writes unit tests, performs code reviews, and runs Playwright E2E tests  
- 🚀 **DevOps Agent** → deploys applications to production  

**Key capabilities:**
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Failure recovery & resumable execution
- Automated testing and validation
- End-to-end delivery, not toy demos

**Tech stack:** LangGraph, OpenAI SDK, MCP Servers (FileServer, Codex, GitHub), React, Playwright, Vercel
